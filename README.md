# Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Banks and financial institutions face the challenge of assessing whether applicants will default on their loans. Poor lending decisions increase non-performing loans (NPLs) and financial losses. This project explores how exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization can reveal patterns in applicant profiles that drive credit risk.

## Solution
- Performed EDA on loan applicant data to identify key factors influencing default risk, such as:
  - Age
  - Income
  - Employment history
  - Loan amount
  - Credit history
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards that allow risk officers to:
  - Compare profiles of defaulters vs. non-defaulters.
  - Track portfolio-level risk indicators (default % by income band, loan purpose, credit score).
  - Make data-informed decisions when evaluating loan applications.

This approach provides managers with a transparent view of lending risk before implementing predictive models.
